# README

hth is a simple habit tracker written in Haskell.

## Usage

Compile with `ghc hth`. After running `hth`, enter `help` for a list of commands.

## Configuration

By default, hth will save your habits to a file in the current directory. To customise this behaviour:

1. Rename hth.sample.json to hth.json.
1. Place the file anywhere in your current directory or system path.
1. Modify the values inside the file.
